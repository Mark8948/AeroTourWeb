# AeroTourWeb

This repository contains the source code for **AeroTour**, a web application developed as a university project for the **Web Information Systems** course at **Roma Tre University**.

## Project Overview

AeroTour is a web application that allows users to explore a catalog of airplanes, book guided tours, and even configure and purchase aircraft. The platform is designed to be simple and accessible to both casual visitors and registered clients, offering an incredible experience into the world of aviation.

The application serves different types of users:
- **Visitors (non-logged-in users)** can browse the public catalog of available aircraft. They can view detailed information, pictures, and specifications but cannot interact with advanced features like booking or purchasing.
- **Clients (logged-in users)** gain access to additional functionality. They can:
  - Book guided tours for specific aircraft.
  - View and manage bookings through a personal dashboard.
  - Configure aircraft according to available customization options.
  - Place orders for personalized aircraft, subject to administrator approval.
- **Administrators** manage the entire catalog and user interactions. They can:
  - Approve or reject aircraft orders.
  - Confirm tour bookings and assign qualified guides.
  - Add new aircraft to the catalog, complete with images and configurable options.

The platform also includes a **secure login and registration system**, which is required for users to unlock full access to AeroTour's features. Once logged in, clients are directed to their **personal area**, where they can:
- View the status of their booked tours.
- Track the progress of aircraft orders.
- Receive notifications about updates and confirmations.

The goal of this project is to simulate a full-stack web application with realistic use cases and roles, focusing on:
- User experience for browsing and interaction.
- Backend logic for managing data consistency.
- Role-based access and administration features.

AeroTour is ideal as a study project for learning the fundamentals of modern web development, especially in scenarios that involve catalog browsing, role-based functionality, data management, and interactive workflows.
